# Firmware for the MSP430-based TAP

Don has said that the pin assignments are likely to change with the next and hopefully final version of the PCB.  We should be able to use the same code with a modification of one header file for the mapping.

• This code is based on the C3_EchoToHost sample code from the Texas Instruments USB Developer's Package.

• Josh's modifications for the 12 MHz crystal were then applied.

• Finally, the TAP specific firmware was added.
