# Wearable Electronics Project: Programmable T-Shirt

Don has volunteered to lead us in designing and manufacturing a wearable electronics project.  We are looking for input and participation in hardware design and software development.  At the end of the design phase we will launch a kickstarter as a fundraiser for TheLab.ms.

• The electronic design and software will be open source.  

• Designed to be modded / hacked with your own code. 

• All proceeds will go to TheLab.ms
